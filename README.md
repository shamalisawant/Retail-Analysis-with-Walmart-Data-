# Retail-Analysis-with-Walmart-Data-
One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. There are certain events and holidays, which impact sales on each day. There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart. The business is facing a challenge due to unforeseen demands and runs out of stock sometimes, due to the inappropriate machine-learning algorithm. An ideal ML algorithm will predict demand accurately and ingest factors like economic conditions including CPI, Unemployment Index, etc.
